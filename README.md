# JHassium

Hassium is a programming language / interpreter originally written in C#. The syntax is a lot like C mixed with Python and it is very easy to learn to program in it.

This is a (not official) port for the Java programming language because of his compatibility.

C# official version link : https://github.com/HassiumTeam/Hassium

Most features (from the C# version) are already available in this version but it is not very stable for now.

Hassium HelloWorld.has:
```go
func main() {
	print("Hello, World!");
}
```
